        <p>Minsan, iniisip ko kung paano ang buhay ko bago kita nakilala. Parang ang daming mga nangyari, mga moments na akala ko, hindi na darating. I've been through heartbreaks, confusion, and thousand "what ifs" na halos sumira sa pag-asa ko.</p>

        <p>But then, you came along. Parang hindi mo agad makikita, pero unti-unti, you just start to realize that you've been waiting for this.</p>

        <p>Minsan, naïisip ko, what did | do to deserve you? And then, I remind myself, hindi na importante kung paano o bakit. What matters is that we found each other, against all odds.</p>

        <p>You showed me na kaya pala ulit sumaya, kaya ulit mangarap.<br>
        Na kahit gaano kahirap mabuhay sa mundong 'to, basta we have each other, everything will be okay.<br>
        And so here l am, thanking God for letting me meet you.</p>

        <p>Hindi ko rin inakala na may mga ganitong bagay akong kayang gawin para mapatunayan ko lang ang pagmamahal ko sa isang tao, Kaya ko pala magsulat at kaya ko pala magcompose.</p>

        <p>At kung hindi naging sapat ang mga letrang isunulat, Sana makita mo ang sarili mong kamahal mahal at may handang tanggapin kung sino ka.</p>

        <p>Naiintindihan ko kung bakit hindi kapa ready para magcommit sakin, Naiintindihan kita palagi sana nakikita mo rin ako katulad ng pagpansin ko sayo.</p>

        <p>It may have been short, it never even had the chance to begin, but every moment with you mattered. Thank you for the memories for the simple conversations, the laughter, and the times you made me feel like I was someone worth loving.</p>

        <p>Maybe it's enough to know that, at some point, you loved me too. Even if we didn't last, even if we became nothing more than a memory, I will always carry the love l once felt in your presence. Thank you for making me feel seen, for being my safe place, for making me whole, for the times when your presence reminded me that I was worthy of love and peace.</p>

        <p>Maybe we met for a reason to teach each other something, to experience a love that, though fleeting, was still worth feeling. Maybe we were never meant to stay, just two souls crossing paths for a love that came but couldn't stay. And maybe that's all we were ever meant to be an almost, a what if, a love that couldn't fight against the odds.</p>

        <p>But I hope, in another life, the universe is kinder to us. I hope there's a version of us that gets it right, that doesn't have to let go. And more than anything, I hope that in that life, you'll choose me not as a fleeting moment, not as an almost, but as the one you never let go of.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the little time we had when we truly made each other happy. I'm really sorry for everything that happened between us. We didn't get the ending I hoped for, but I'm still grateful because I once had you-someone who made me feel whole and became such an important part of my life.</p>

        <p>Now, wherever you choose to be happy, I'll support you, even if it's no longer with me.<br>
        Please take care of yourself, because I won't be there to do it anymore. Even though things ended this way, and even though we hurt each other, you'll always be a beautiful memory that l'll carry with me.</p>

        <p>I didn't leave you, you pushed me away. Your actions told me to stop so I did<br>
        I stopped saving us to same my self. Im done chasing attention of other people, that wasn't giving me the same energy back.</p>

        <p>I didn't have any plans on giving up on you but its your treatment made me give up.</p>

        <p>You actions made me feel like its not right for me to be there, so I walk away.</p>

        <p>If the effort you’d spend on me is empty promises, I guess I was with the wrong person.<br>
        You make me feel unwanted.</p>

        <p>Because love cannot be shown by just saying it, it is also felt through actions.</p>

        <p>I just realized how much I allowed you to disrespect me just because I loved you. I stayed silent when you hurt me, accepted the bare minimum when I deserved so much more, and kept giving pieces of myself hoping you'd finally see my worth but all I did was slowly lose my voice, my confidence, and the love once had for myself, all while you took my loyalty for granted, dismissed my feelings like they were a burden, and made me question if I was ever enough, when all lever did was love you with everything had, even when it was hurting me to do so, even when I cried myself to sleep wondering what more I could do, even when I started to shrink myself just to fit into the space you gave me, thinking that if I was quieter, easier, more understanding, maybe you'd choose to treat me right but you never did, and now I'm left picking up the broken pieces of someone I barely recognize.</p>

        <p>I hope one day you realize that I was someone who would've done anything for you someone who was genuinely happy just to be with you, who gave everything to make you feel loved. I tried so hard to hold us together, to make things right so you'd never want to leave. I always put you first, even when it hurt, and it broke me when you started to change. loved you completely and sincerely.</p>

        <p>But somewhere along the way, you made me feel worthless and unappreciated. No matter how much I tried, every little mistake or thing you didn't like made you snap and turn cold.<br>
        Nakakasama talaga ng loob kasi para lang sa maliliit na bagay, nagagawa mo akong tratuhin ng ganon. I know you're tired and have a lot on your mind, but all I ever did was try to help you and make things easier for you.</p>

        <p>Alam ko na never moko hahabulin at hahayaan nalang. Siguro ito na ang last act of love ko para sayo. Naisip ko na hindi sapat ang pagmamahal, Hindi sapat na ako lang ang nagmamahal. Mahal na mahal kita kyla alam na alam mo yan. I’m here lang always if need mo katulong sa schoolworks I’m willing to help pa rin. Ingat ka, I love you so much.</p>
