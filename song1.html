            I dedicated this song for you because it’s a reminder that there is someone who will stay.
            Someone who will choose you every single day, even when loving you is hard.
            <br><br>
            As humans, we all have sides that are difficult to handle. We have parts of us that are
            confusing, broken, and heavy. But when you show those parts to the right person,
            they don’t run away — they choose to accept them, to embrace them, because those
            pieces are part of who you are.
            <br><br>
            What’s beautiful is when someone chooses you all over again. When they understand you,
            when they truly see you. I love deeply, and I study a person like a language  so I can be
            fluent in loving them. Even when you don’t explain yourself, it’s okay. I understand.
            <br><br>
            This song feels like a promise: no matter how many times you push me away,
            I’ll still be here. I won’t walk away. I won’t give up.
            I’ll keep choosing you every single time.
        </p>
